<h2>Instructions</h2>

<ol>
	<h3>Making the sauce:</h3>
	<li>
		Beef lasagna recipe starts with the most important step – making the
		soffrito! This is the key to a tastier filling so add a generous amount of
		extra virgin olive oil to a large pot and let it slowly heat.
	</li>
	<li>
		Next, add the chopped up carrot, celery and onion and leave to cook for 5-10
		minutes or until it has started to soften.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add the mincemeat to your pot and break it down using a wooden spoon while
		it starts to brown. Leave to simmer and stir every so often until it has
		started to brown.
	</li>
	<li>
		Once the mincemeat for your beef lasagna has browned, add the glass of red
		wine and stir through with a wooden spoon. Leave this to simmer until it
		evaporates remembering to stir every so often.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add 1 ½ bottles passata and stir through. Make sure the stove is on a
		medium-low heat, then cover the pot and let simmer for one hour.
	</li>
	<li>
		Go back to the pot every now and then and stir the sauce using a wooden
		spoon.
	</li>
	<li>
		After one hour, remove the lid and you will notice the tomato has reduced.
		Add one glass of water at this point and let cook on a low heat. Add more
		water if you believe it has dried up too much otherwise leave as it is.
	</li>
	<li>
		The sauce needs another hour to cook with the lid off. Remember to stir it!
	</li>

	<h3>How to make the béchamel sauce:</h3>
	<li>
		Next, the béchamel! Put the small saucepan on your stove at a low heat and
		add butter.
	</li>
	<li>
		Leave to melt slowly then add flour and quickly stir using a whisk. Keep
		doing this until the flour has disappeared.
	</li>
	<li>
		Slowly add the milk (around 1/4 at first) and don't stop stirring! Continue
		adding the milk and stirring – be gentle yet firm. This will avoid it from
		sticking to the bottom and also from forming lumps.
	</li>
	<li>
		The sauce should start to become creamy and thick – stop once you have
		reached your desired consistency.
	</li>
	<li>Turn off the stove and add a sprinkle of salt and nutmeg.</li>

	<h3>Assembling the lasagna:</h3>
	<li>
		Line the baking tray with extra virgin olive oil or melted butter, using a
		pastry brush.
	</li>
	<li>
		Adjust the size of the lasagna sheets according to your dish so they fit
		nicely just by cutting them to size.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add a scoop of beef lasagna sauce to the bottom of the try and spread it all
		over, before laying down the first layer of lasagna sheets.
	</li>
	<li>
		Next scoop more sauce over the top of the pasta and spread it (using the
		bottom of a tablespoon or a wooden one) before sprinkling
		pecorino/parmigiano cheese on top, then add provolone and fresh mozzarella
		(your desired amount).
	</li>
	<li>Add some béchamel – not too much and spread it slightly.</li>
	<li>
		Add another layer of pasta sheets then repeat step 17 until you create the
		number of layers you wish – I aim for 5-6!
	</li>
	<li>
		Add plain basil tomato sauce on top, spreading it all over, edge to edge and
		in each corner too.
	</li>
	<li>
		Coverv the beef lasagna with foil and place in a pre-heated oven for 20
		minutes at 180°C/350°F (fan forced).
	</li>
	<li>
		Remove from the oven and take the foil off, before adding a generous
		sprinkle (all over) of pecorino/parmigiano cheese.
	</li>
	<li>
		Bake in the oven again (no foil) for another 10 minutes then remove and let
		cool.
	</li>
	<li>E ora si mangia, Vincenzo's Plate….Enjoy!</li>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
	<h3>How to make the rice</h3>
	<li>
		Start this Sicilian arancini recipe by adding five tablespoons of extra
		virgin olive oil into a large pot on medium heat with ¼ of chopped onion.
		Stir constantly until the onion is golden brown (about seven minutes).
	</li>
	<li>
		Once browned, add the vegetable stock, butter, and one tablespoon of tomato
		paste and bring this to a boil.
	</li>
	<li>
		Next, add the rice, stir quickly, then cover with the lid. Cook the rice
		until the water absorbs, making sure to stir occasionally.
	</li>
	<li>
		When the rice is ready, add in another portion of butter, stirring until it
		melts so it will be extra delicious.
	</li>
	<li>
		Now spread the hot rice straight onto your chilled tray reaching right into
		the edges using a wooden spoon – be gentle or the rice could break! Then top
		with pecorino or parmesan cheese.
	</li>
	<li>
		Let the rice rest for about one hour so it can cool and the cheese will melt
		into it.
	</li>

	<h3>How to make the Arancini filling</h3>
	<li>
		Let's make the beautiful filling for the Sicilian arancini! Place a large
		pan on the stove at a medium heat, then add a generous amount of EVOO and
		the celery, onions, carrot.
	</li>
	<li>Cook this sofrito for about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
	<li>
		Then, add the ground beef until it is browned. Stir constantly to create a
		beautiful flavor – this arancini recipe is all about the most sensational
		aromas and flavours!
	</li>
	<li>
		Add the peas, tomato paste, a splash of water, and tear some basil with your
		hands before adding it to the pan. Keep stirring until everything is
		combined. Then drop the heat to a lower temperature and let this simmer for
		about 20 minutes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Stir the mixture and add water as needed, so the arancini filling does not
		dry out—season with salt and freshly ground pepper.
	</li>
	<li>
		Transfer the cooked meat mixture to a large bowl to cool down in the fridge
		for one hour.
	</li>

	<h3>How to assemble this Arancini recipe:</h3>
	<li>
		Now that the rice and filling are prepped, it's time for the final Sicilian
		arancini assembly! Before you start, slice the fresh mozzarella into small
		cubes, as this will help it to melt better!
	</li>
	<li>
		Take your chilled rice and form a pocket in the palm of your hand; add a
		generous amount of meat and cheese "filling" into the middle.
	</li>
	<li>
		Add another scoop of rice and form into a ball by pressing to get the
		moisture out.
	</li>
	<li>
		Place your formed Sicilian rice balls on a baking tray lined with baking
		paper.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you don't have eggs, you can make a "pastella" which is a mixture of
		flour and water to coat the arancini balls with before finishing them off
		with breadcrumbs. OR, use two beaten eggs and coat each ball. Then roll each
		one in fresh breadcrumbs.
	</li>
	<li>
		Set these aside on a tray lined with baking paper. Repeat until you have
		coated each rice ball.
	</li>
	<li>
		Bring sunflower oil to 180°C/356°F in a pot on your stove, then add a few
		rice balls in at a time (depending on the size of your pot), making sure
		they have enough room.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fry each ball for about 5-7 minutes, or until they are golden brown and the
		cheese inside has melted.
	</li>
	<li>E ora si mangia, Vincenzo's Plate….Enjoy!</li>
